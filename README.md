* prepare directory for project code and virtualenv:

      $ mkdir -p ~/CLIapp

      $ cd ~/CLIapp

      $ virtualenv --python=python3 amity-venv

      $ source amity-venv/bin/activate
* check out project code:

      $ git clone https://github.com/daisyndungu/cp1-amity-allocation.git

* install requirements into virtualenv:

      $ pip install -r cp1-amity-allocation/requirements.txt
